! How to build

This was tested only under Linux and might not work on Windows system.

```
make clean 
TIDDLYWIKI_PATH=~/dev/tiddlywiki # update the path to point to correct location
make build
cd output/demo 
caddy file-server
```

! Hosting on github pages

By default github uses jerkill preprocessing on gh-pages. You have to disable it
by creating empty `.nojekyll` file at the root of the web site.
Otherwise the files which name starts with `_` (which is `/` in tiddler name) 
wouldn't be displayed.
