# How to build

This was tested only under Linux and might not work on Windows system.

```
make clean 
TIDDLYWIKI_PATH=~/dev/tiddlywiki # update the path to point to correct location
make build
cd output/demo 
caddy file-server
```

## Deploying to github pages

The deployment to gh-pages should happen automaticly on every PR merge

# Github Actions

Unfortunatelly due to [github bug/feature](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/Github-action-not-triggering-gh-pages-upon-push/td-p/26869/highlight/true/page/2)
we cannot use `GITHUB_TOKEN` and have to configure ssh access to the repo. The process is documented [here](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages#1-add-ssh-deploy-key).
I hope the issue would be fixed and we can revert to fully automatic approach.
